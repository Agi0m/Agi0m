# Trying to make the perfect fresh install configs


Current distro I'm using: Linux Mint 21.1 "Vera"


Knowledge on coding: Just some basics on bash and html

I still have not created any config for myself

To do :  Create a simple after install script to change any desktop fit my needs 

Inspired by : Erik Dubois

## Update Script
I would recommend when you use the update script to just avoid the held back packages between Ubuntu and Linux Mint because it may damage the system or just use the Update Manager from the Linux Mint team it works great.

### Conky
The regulus conky needs a few adjustments to match the cores of the cpu in order to work properly because it won't start unless you fix those in the config ~/.config/concky/Regulus/Regulus.conf
