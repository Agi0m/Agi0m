# Trying to make the perfect fresh install configs


* Current distro I'm using: Linux Mint 21.1 _"Vera"_


* Knowledge on coding: Just some basics on bash and html.
  I still have not created any config for myself

* To do :  Create a simple after install script to change any desktop fit my needs 

Inspired by : Erik Dubois

## Update Script
I would recommend when you use the update script to just **avoid** the held back packages between Ubuntu and Linux Mint because it may damage the system or just use the _Update Manager_ from the Linux Mint team it works great.

### Conky
The regulus conky needs a few **adjustments to match the cores of the cpu** in order to work properly because it won't start unless you fix those in the config _**~/.config/concky/Regulus/Regulus.conf**_
